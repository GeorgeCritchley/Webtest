</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Universal Credit provides support for people who are working and earning a low income, as well as for those looking for a job.</p>
<p>As an employer you may already have some employees who are Universal Credit claimants, and you are likely to have more in the future.</p>
<p>The information on this page is intended to help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>make best use of the opportunities that Universal Credit brings your business</li>
<li>support your employees with accurate and useful information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why does Universal Credit benefit employers?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>People who claim Universal Credit will be more open to short-term work or flexible hours. Universal Credit payments adjust automatically as earnings change, so people can take on temporary, part-time or additional work without needing to work out what it means for their benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal Credit removes the old &lsquo;16 hour&rsquo; rule as payments are based on earnings rather than the number of hours worked</li>
<li>People claiming Universal Credit can even accept full-time seasonal work for up to 6 months without needing to close their claim</li>
<li>Entry-level jobs, which are often crucial to starting a working life, will be more attractive to a broader range of candidates. People claiming Universal Credit can take a chance on a new career because Universal Credit supports them as they take their first steps into work.</li>
<li>Universal Credit provides more generous childcare support, providing families with greater confidence to change their hours or take up job offers they may have previously thought not possible due to childcare commitments.</li>
<li>Universal Credit payments are calculated using the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) real time information you send to HMRC. This simpler and more accurate system means you will get fewer wage enquiries.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary of advantages for&nbsp;employers</h2>
<p>By making it easier for people to vary the number of hours they work each week or take a temporary job, Universal Credit can help provide your business with a more flexible workforce.&nbsp;Universal Credit also encourages people to progress in work and make the most of their potential, equipping you with a skilled and ambitious workforce.</p>

<h1><br />Page 2 -&nbsp;Common questions from employees</h1>
<h2><br />Introduction</h2>
<p>If you are an employer or recruiter, this information can help you answer any questions your employees and workers may have about Universal Credit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>What is Universal Credit?</h2>
<br />Universal Credit helps you if you are on a low wage by topping up your earnings. If your earnings change, your Universal Credit top up will change automatically to help make sure you are better off in work.<br /><br />The amount of Universal Credit you get will gradually reduce as you earn more, but unlike Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance your payment won&rsquo;t stop just because you work more than 16 hours a week.</li>
<li>
<h2>Can I take extra shifts or work more hours?</h2>
<br />Yes, you can work more hours. This will have no negative impact on your Universal Credit. <br /><br />If there are extra hours available from your employer it is worth taking these on as your Universal Credit is based on your income and not the number of hours you work. This means your Universal Credit won&rsquo;t stop just because you work more than 16 hours a week.<br /><br /></li>
<li>
<h2>If I earn more will I not be able to claim Universal Credit?</h2>
<br />You can earn a certain amount, which is based on your individual circumstances, before your Universal Credit payment is reduced. Once you earn above that amount your Universal Credit payments will be reduced at a steady rate.<br /><br />The more you earn, the higher your total income will be, which helps make sure that you will be better off in work than claiming Universal Credit. Once you are earning enough money through work you will no longer receive Universal Credit payments.<br /><br />The Department for Work and Pensions will automatically notify you if this is the case and your claim will close.<br /><br />If you need to come back onto Universal Credit within 6 months of your previous claim ending the Department for Work and Pensions will make it easy for you to do this.</li>
